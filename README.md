# 📌 CSSharp Hide Admin Events
Hide admin info on PlayerTeam and PlayerDisconnect events.

## 🌐 Description
Most of the server owners encounter situations where cheaters or other types of players check the in-game chat for team join or disonnect. Why? For the presence of known admins. This plugin hide them on those events. Therefore, admins get a few more seconds or even minutes before their presence is observed by others when they join a team. The same concept applies on disconnection.
